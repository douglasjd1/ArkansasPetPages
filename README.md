Thanks for taking a look at my project! This is my final project for the Arkansas Coding Academy. It was designed to make it
easier for people in the Arkansas area to connect with dog breeders, shelters, and other dog lovers, as well as  help people
find their ideal dog, whether it be a resuce at a shelter or a pure bred.

For this project, I used Intellij IDEA and Maria DB. You'll need those to get it running. All of the data can be found in the DB folder
(arkansaspetpagesdb.sql) and loaded by copy-pasting the code into MariaDB. To host it locally, use CMD to locate the folder containing
the project, and then use the command 'sbt run' and type 'localhost:9000/home' into your browser window.

Here are some screenshots, so you can get a feel for what the site is like.
